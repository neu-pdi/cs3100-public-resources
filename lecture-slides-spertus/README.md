# Lecture Slides

These are the lecture slides for Prof. Spertus' sections. Lecture slides complement the lecture notes in the [lecture-notes](../lecture-notes) directory, and it is suggested that students read the lecture notes in advance of lecture. The lecture notes also contain links to supplementary material that may be useful for further study.

See also: [Lecture Slides](../lecture-slides) for the general lecture slides.

## Overview

The final project presentation is your opportunity to showcase the complete CookYourBooks application your team has built. You'll demonstrate all core features and your Feature Buffet selections, present key architecture decisions, and reflect on your team's collaboration experience.

This is not a separately graded assignment—instead, it serves as a capstone experience and provides an opportunity for peer learning across teams.

**Presentation Date:** Week 15 (see course schedule for exact date)

**Duration:** 12-15 minutes per team + 3-5 minutes Q&A

## Presentation Components

### 1. Live Demo (5-6 minutes)

Demonstrate your application with a realistic user scenario:

**Suggested flow:**
1. Start with an empty or minimal library
2. Import a recipe from an image (show OCR in action)
3. Browse the library, search for something
4. Edit a recipe, scale ingredients
5. Demonstrate 1-2 of your Feature Buffet selections
6. Show any unique or polished aspects of your UI

**Tips:**
- Practice the demo multiple times
- Have backup screenshots/video if live demo fails
- Use realistic recipe data (not "Test Recipe 1")
- Show both happy path and one error handling scenario

### 2. "Our Feature" Pitch (2-3 minutes)

Present the custom feature your team designed in GA0—the one you **didn't** implement:

- What user need does it address?
- Show your wireframes/design concept
- Brief technical considerations
- Why you chose not to build it (honest assessment of scope/complexity)

This demonstrates your ability to think beyond implementation to **product vision**. Great "Our Feature" presentations show creative thinking constrained by realistic engineering judgment.

### 3. Architecture Highlights (2-3 minutes)

Present 2-3 key architectural decisions:

**Possible topics:**
- How MVVM enabled testability and individual accountability
- How you integrated the OCR port with multiple backends (if applicable)
- How you handled async operations and UI updates
- How your team's lexicon evolved during development
- A refactoring that improved code quality

**Include:**
- Brief diagram or code snippet
- The problem you were solving
- Alternatives you considered
- Why you chose your approach

### 4. Team Reflection (2-3 minutes)

Honest reflection on collaboration:

- What worked well in your team process?
- What would you do differently?
- One thing each team member learned from this experience
- Advice for future students tackling this project

## Deliverables

### Before Presentation

Submit to course website:

1. **Presentation slides** (PDF)
2. **Demo backup** (screen recording in case of technical issues)
3. **Brief sustainability report** (1 page): Consider the four dimensions of software sustainability. How would you improve CookYourBooks for long-term maintainability?

### After Presentation

Submit within 24 hours:

1. **Peer evaluation survey** (rates other teams' presentations)
2. **Self-evaluation** (brief reflection on your own presentation)

## Sustainability Report

As discussed in [L36: Sustainability](/lecture-notes/l36-sustainability), software sustainability has four dimensions:

| Dimension | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| **Technical** | Is the code maintainable? What technical debt exists? |
| **Economic** | What would it cost to continue development? |
| **Social** | Does the app serve diverse users well? Accessibility status? |
| **Environmental** | Energy efficiency? Data storage implications? |

Write 1 page addressing:
1. Current state of your application across these dimensions
2. Top 3 improvements you'd prioritize for a "v2.0"
3. Potential risks if the application were deployed to real users

## Presentation Tips

### Technical Setup
- Test your demo on the presentation computer beforehand
- Have the application running before your slot
- Know how to quickly recover from crashes

### Delivery
- Each team member should speak
- Practice transitions between speakers
- Time yourselves—10-12 minutes goes fast
- Leave time for Q&A

### What Makes a Great Presentation
- Authentic reflection (not just "everything went great")
- Specific examples (not just "we communicated well")
- Pride in your work balanced with honest assessment
- Engagement with the audience

## Q&A Preparation

Be ready to answer:
- "What was the hardest bug to fix?"
- "How did you divide work among team members?"
- "What would you add with another week?"
- "How did AI tools help or hinder your work?"
- "What surprised you about GUI development?"

## Schedule

Teams will be assigned presentation slots during Week 14. Order is randomized.

Each slot:
- 10-12 minutes presentation
- 3-5 minutes Q&A
- 2 minutes transition

## Peer Evaluation

After all presentations, rate each team (not your own) on:
- Demo quality and polish
- Architecture explanation clarity
- Reflection honesty and insight
- Overall presentation quality

This is for feedback purposes and does not affect grades.

Congratulations on completing CookYourBooks! This project has taken you from basic domain modeling through hexagonal architecture, testing with mocks, CLI and GUI development, team collaboration, and user-centered design. These skills form the foundation for professional software development.

Good luck with your presentations!

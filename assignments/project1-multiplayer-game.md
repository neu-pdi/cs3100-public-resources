# Project 1: Multiplayer Game Platform

## Due Date
Monday, March 16, 2026 at 8:00 PM EDT

## Overview

Design and implement a multiplayer game platform that demonstrates your understanding of software engineering principles, design patterns, concurrent programming, and network communication.

## Learning Objectives

- Design a complex, multi-component system
- Implement network communication between clients and server
- Handle concurrency and thread safety
- Apply multiple design patterns in a cohesive system
- Write maintainable, extensible code
- Create comprehensive documentation

## Project Requirements

### Core Features (Required)

1. **Game Server (40%)**
   - Support multiple simultaneous games
   - Handle player connections and disconnections gracefully
   - Implement game state management
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Persistent game history

2. **Game Client (30%)**
   - User-friendly interface (GUI or TUI)
   - Real-time game updates
   - Connection management
   - Input validation

3. **Game Logic (20%)**
   - Implement at least one complete game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four)
   - Turn-based gameplay
   - Win/lose/draw detection
   - Player statistics tracking

4. **Testing & Documentation (10%)**
   - Unit tests for game logic
   - Integration tests for client-server communication
   - Comprehensive README
   - API documentation

### Advanced Features (Choose 2 for Extra Credit)

- AI opponent using minimax algorithm (+15%)
- Spectator mode for watching games (+10%)
- Chat system between players (+10%)
- Replay system for past games (+10%)
- Support for multiple game types (+15%)

## Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Java 17+
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle
- **Testing**: JUnit 5
- **Version Control**: Git with meaningful commits
- **Design Patterns**: Must use at least 4 different patterns appropriately

## Deliverables

1. **Source Code**
   - Well-organized package structure
   - Clean, documented code
   - Comprehensive test suite

2. **Design Document** (5-10 pages)
   - System architecture
   - UML diagrams (class, sequence, component)
   - Design pattern usage justification
   - Testing strategy

3. **User Guide**
   - How to run the server
   - How to run the client
   - How to play the game

4. **Demo Video** (5-10 minutes)
   - System overview
   - Feature demonstration
   - Code walkthrough of interesting parts

## Submission

1. Push final code to GitHub repository
2. Upload design document, user guide, and video link to Canvas
3. Submit repository URL on Canvas
4. Schedule a demo session with the instructor

## Grading Rubric

- **Architecture & Design (25%)**: Well-designed system, appropriate patterns
- **Implementation (35%)**: Working features, code quality
- **Concurrency & Networking (20%)**: Thread-safe, robust networking
- **Testing (10%)**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation (10%)**: Clear, complete documentation

## Team Option

This project can be done individually or in teams of 2. Teams are expected to deliver more features and higher quality.

## Getting Started

1. Review network programming in Java
2. Study the provided example server/client template
3. Design your system architecture before coding
4. Implement core features first, then add enhancements
5. Test continuously throughout development

## Resources

- Java Socket Programming Tutorial
- Concurrency in Practice (book)
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
- Office hours: Schedule early and often!

# Cook Your Books: Project Overview


Throughout this semester, you will build CookYourBooks, a comprehensive desktop application for managing digital cookbooks and recipes. This real-world application addresses a common problem: how to efficiently digitize, organize, and use recipes from physical cookbooks and websites. The final product will feature recipe import from images via the Gemini API, a rich domain model for representing complex recipe structures, intelligent scaling and unit conversion, and both command-line and graphical user interfaces. By the end of the course, you'll have created a fully-functional application that could genuinely be used by home cooks and professional chefs alike—something substantial enough for your portfolio that demonstrates your ability to design and implement complex software systems. For inspiration on what a real-world application might look like, refer to existing products [EatYourBooks](https://eatyourbooks.com/), [ChefSteps' Recipe Interface](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/skillet-apple-pie), and [CookShelf](https://www.cookshelf.app/).

The project follows a carefully scaffolded approach where each weekly assignment builds upon the previous one, with our solution to each assignment provided as the foundation for the next. You'll begin in Module 1 (Design in the Small) by implementing the core domain model—learning to design rich object hierarchies for ingredients, quantities, and recipes while practicing fundamental OO principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. As you progress into Module 2 (Design in the Large), you'll add persistence through custom JSON serialization, build comprehensive test suites with mocking, create service layers that separate business logic from infrastructure concerns, and explore architecture patterns for distributed systems. Starting in Assignment 3 (Week 5-6), you'll incorporate AI coding assistants into your workflow, learning to leverage these tools effectively while maintaining code quality and understanding.

The final phase of the project (Module 3: Design for Users) emphasizes user-centered design, team collaboration, and building complete systems. You'll implement both CLI and GUI interfaces, focusing on usability, accessibility, and user experience while managing the complexity of asynchronous operations such as Gemini API–based recipe import. Working in teams of four (or three; see the 3-person-team exception below), each team member takes ownership of one core GUI feature while collaborating on shared infrastructure, integration, and optional "menu" features. Teams establish working agreements through a **team charter**, align on user-facing terminology for consistent naming, and practice the HRT (Humility, Respect, Trust) principles from professional software development. The group assignments are structured to enable individual accountability—each core feature has a defined ViewModel interface that all implementations must satisfy—while still requiring meaningful collaboration on design, code review, and integration. Throughout this journey, you'll not only master Java and JavaFX, but also develop crucial software engineering skills: interpreting requirements, designing for change, writing maintainable code, and collaborating effectively in a team.

Assignments are structured to provide a steady, manageable pace throughout the semester. Each assignment is due on a Thursday at 11:59 PM, with a minimum of 3-4 days between assignment due dates to ensure adequate time for implementation, testing, and reflection. Some weeks' tasks have been intentionally merged to combine related concepts and create more substantial programming tasks that better reflect real-world development work. 

**Notes:**
- Each assignment builds on the provided solution from the previous week. Students are trusted to not share these solutions, or to seek them out.
- AI coding assistants are introduced in Week 5 (Assignment 3) and encouraged thereafter. Students are strongly discouraged from using them in the first two assignments.
- Group work begins in Week 10 (teams of 4 formed by Week 8, or teams of 3). Each team member owns one core GUI feature while collaborating on shared infrastructure and the Feature Buffet. **3-person teams:** You may omit the Search & Filter core feature; each member then owns one of the remaining three (Library View, Recipe Editor, Import Interface). Ownership and grading apply only to the features you implement. Automated grading and checkpoint tests run only against the ViewModel interfaces for those features (three or four); Feature Buffet and process-grading expectations are unchanged for 3- and 4-person teams.
- The group project (GA1+GA2+Final) is released as **one specification** with accountability checkpoints. **Features must be delivered incrementally**—it is not possible to complete the project at the last minute. Students receive automated grading feedback at checkpoints; full instructor feedback comes at the end. Core features are graded individually via automated tests against the defined ViewModel interfaces for the features your team implements (four, or three if you use the 3-person-team exception). Feature Buffet items are graded primarily on **process** (design iteration, code review quality, documentation) rather than product.
- Labs complement but don't depend on the main project assignments - they always build on a solution from a week earlier.

## **Module 3: Design for Users (Group Work Begins)**

Group assignments are structured around **individual accountability with team collaboration**. Each team member owns one of four core GUI features, implementing against a provided ViewModel interface that enables automated grading. Teams also collaborate on shared infrastructure, integration, and choose additional "menu" features to implement together.

**Weekly collaboration surveys** are due Mar 16, Mar 23, Mar 30, Apr 6, and Apr 13—submit via Pawtograder. These brief check-ins factor into individual accountability adjustments.

**Important:** The group project (GA1+GA2+Final) is released as a single specification with two accountability checkpoints. **You cannot wait until the end to complete this project**—features must be delivered incrementally, and each checkpoint requires working functionality. You should expect only automated grading feedback at checkpoints; full instructor/TA feedback will be provided at the end. Plan your work from day one and use your team's code review process for iterative improvement.

### Mandatory Group Processes

Two recurring processes run throughout the group project and are **required** for full credit:

**Weekly Team Collaboration Surveys** — Due each Monday (Mar 16, Mar 23, Mar 30, Apr 6, Apr 13) via Pawtograder. Each survey asks you to briefly reflect on the team's dynamics, your own contributions that week, and any blockers or tensions. Responses are not shared with teammates but are visible to your TA group mentor, who uses them to lead retrospectives and guide team dynamics. They feed directly into the individual accountability adjustments for GA1, GA2, and the Final Report.

**Weekly TA Mentor Meetings** — Your team meets with your assigned TA mentor for 30 minutes each week. Every team member is expected to attend and to explain what they worked on—including the design decisions behind their code. The meeting also covers progress relative to upcoming checkpoints and next steps. These meetings are not a scheduling formality; they are the primary mechanism by which TA mentors verify that each team member understands their own code and is contributing meaningfully.

- **If you can attend:** show up prepared to walk through your code and explain why you made the choices you made.
- **If you cannot attend:** notify your TA *before* the meeting and send a written update covering your work status. This demonstrates accountability.
- **Missing without prior notice** signals a lack of accountability and will likely result in a zero for that week's individual accountability component.

### Accountability Overview

The group project is structured so that **individual contributions are independently verifiable at every stage**, even within a team grade. This reflects how accountability works in professional software teams: you are responsible for your own work and for being someone your teammates can rely on (see [L22: Teams and Collaboration](/lecture-notes/l22-teams) for the full accountability framework).

Individual accountability is assessed through three lenses and affects your grade directly:

| Mechanism | What it measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **TA mentor meeting observations** | Can you explain your code and design decisions? Are you contributing week to week? |
| **Weekly collaboration surveys** | Is the team working well? Are contributions equitable? |
| **Peer evaluation** | How do your teammates assess your collaboration and contribution? |

Each checkpoint rubric includes an **Individual Accountability Adjustment** of up to ±20 points. Note also that, as part of the [Final Report](/assignments/cyb13-final-report), the individual reflection is a **mandatory submission gate**: your team and individual grades are not released until your reflection is submitted.

The accountability adjustments are not punitive—they exist to protect teammates who carry their weight from being penalized by those who don't, and to reward collaborative behavior that isn't always visible in code alone.

### **Week 11-12: Design Sprint and Team Formation**
- [**Group Assignment 0: Design Sprint**](/assignments/cyb10-design-sprint) (Due 2026-03-26)
  - Build on A5 solution (provided)
  - **Team Foundation:**
    - Create **Team Charter**: communication norms, availability, decision-making process, conflict resolution plan, accountability expectations
    - Assign feature ownership: each member claims one of the four core features (or three if your team has three members and omits Search & Filter)
  - **Individual Deliverables (per team member):**
    - User persona for your feature area (who uses this feature? what are their goals?)
    - Low-fidelity wireframes for your feature
    - Accessibility considerations: how will your feature support keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.?
  - **Team Deliverables:**
    - Architecture diagram: how do ViewModels connect to existing services from A5?
    - Integrated wireframe document showing navigation flow and shared UI elements
    - **Feature Buffet selection**: choose 2-3 features for Checkpoint 2 with rationale
    - **"Our Feature" concept**: design a custom feature (not on buffet) to present in final demo
  - *Grading: 50% individual, 50% team*
- [**Lab 11: User-Centered Design**](/labs/lab11-ucd) (Week 12)
  - Practice UCD techniques and user research methods

### **Week 12-15: Group Project**
- [**Group Project: CookYourBooks GUI**](/assignments/cyb11-core-features) (Released 2026-03-23)
  
  This is a **single project** with two accountability checkpoints. The full specification is available from day one—plan your work accordingly. **Checkpoints require working, tested features**; later checkpoints build on earlier ones, so it is impossible to leave everything until the final week. You will receive automated test feedback at each checkpoint, but comprehensive instructor feedback comes only at the final submission.

- [**Lab 12: GUI Programming**](/labs/lab12-gui) (Week 13)
  - JavaFX workshop

  - Practice with CompletableFutures

  #### **Checkpoint 1: Core Features** (Due 2026-04-09)
  - **You are provided:** ViewModel interfaces (contracts) for each of the four core features (or three if your team uses the 3-person exception and omits Search & Filter), plus a shared test suite. Automated tests run only against the ViewModel interfaces for the features your team implements.
  - **Core Features (one owner per team member):**
    1. **Library View**: Browse cookbooks/collections, navigation, collection management
    2. **Recipe Details/Editor**: View and edit recipe content, ingredient list, validation
    3. **Import Interface**: Image upload, Gemini-based import progress feedback, error handling, async operations
    4. **Search & Filter**: Search by title/ingredient, tag filtering, keyboard navigation *(3-person teams omit this feature; each member owns one of 1–3)*
  - **Individual Deliverables:**
    - ViewModel implementation that passes the provided automated tests for your feature
    - View implementation (FXML + controller) that binds to your ViewModel
    - Additional unit tests beyond the provided suite

    - Integration tests verifying interactions between implemented core features
    - Evidence of code review (meaningful PR comments applying HRT principles)
  - *Checkpoint grading: 70% individual (ViewModel tests), 30% team (integration). Same for 3- and 4-person teams; grading applies only to implemented features.*

- [**Lab 14: Prep for Future of Programming**](/labs/lab14-future-prep) (Week 15)
  - Explore emerging trends in software development

  #### **Checkpoint 2: Feature Buffet** (Due 2026-04-16)

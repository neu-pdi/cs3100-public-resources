## Compare relative latencies across the memory hierarchy (5 minutes)

(CPU registers → L1/L2 cache → RAM → disk → network)

## Estimate the time and space complexity of a simple algorithm (20 minutes)

## Understand garbage collection in Java and how to avoid memory leaks (15 minutes)

- How the JVM manages memory (heap, stack, GC roots)
- Mark-and-sweep basics
- Common causes of memory leaks (static references, listeners, caches)
- Tools for detecting memory issues

## Apply common patterns to improve performance (15 minutes)

### Caching

### Object pooling and reuse

### Rate-limiting and buffering

### Parallelization

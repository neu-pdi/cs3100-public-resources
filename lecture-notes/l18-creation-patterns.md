## Review the creation patterns you have already implemented (5 minutes)

:::note Information Hiding In Action
Creation patterns are information hiding applied to *object construction*. In [Lecture 6](/lecture-notes/l6-immutability-abstraction), we learned to hide implementation details behind interfaces. Now we hide *how objects are created*—the specific constructors, the validation logic, the wiring of dependencies—behind factory methods and builders. The client code says "give me a Recipe" without knowing the 15 steps required to construct one correctly.
:::

- Recap: Students implemented Builder (`RecipeBuilder`), used Factory methods (`StandardConversions`), created registries
- Frame this lecture as "what you learned, formalized—and where it leads"
- Connect to information hiding and DIP from L8

## Evaluate the tradeoffs in readability, reusability, and changeability between object creation patterns in Java (15 minutes)

### Static Factory Methods (Bloch Item 1)
- Example: `StandardConversions.getRule()` from HW2
- Advantages over constructors: naming, caching, return subtypes
- Not the same as Factory *Pattern*
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - *Readability*: Named methods (`of()`, `from()`, `create()`) clearer than `new` (?)
  - *Reusability*: Can return cached instances or subtypes
  - *Changeability*: Can change implementation without changing call sites

### Builder Pattern (Bloch Item 2)
- Example: `RecipeBuilder` from HW2
- When to use: many constructor parameters, immutable objects, fluent APIs
- Discuss: How did your implementation handle notes? (design decision they made)
- Variations: telescoping constructors vs. builders, record builders
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - *Readability*: Fluent API makes construction self-documenting
  - *Reusability*: Builders can be reused to create similar objects
  - *Changeability*: New optional parameters don't break existing code

### Singleton Pattern (Bloch Items 3-4)
- The controversial pattern: global state, testability concerns
- Why it exists: expensive resources, configuration, coordination
- *Why this pattern is problematic—sets up the DI discussion*
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - *Readability*: Simple access, but hides dependencies
  - *Reusability*: Difficult to reuse code that depends on singletons
  - *Changeability*: Hard to swap implementations, breaks testability

## Describe Dependency Injection as a solution to the problems of Singleton (10 minutes)

### The problem Singleton is trying to solve
- "I need access to this one thing everywhere"
- Hidden dependencies make code hard to test and reason about

### Dependency Injection as the solution
- Constructor injection (what students already did with `ConversionRegistry`)
- The DIP from L8 in action: depend on abstractions, inject implementations
- Compare: explicit wiring vs. what DI frameworks automate

### Types of injection
- Constructor injection (preferred—makes dependencies explicit)
- Setter injection (for optional dependencies)
- Field injection (convenient but hides dependencies)

## Compare Service Locator and Dependency Injection patterns (10 minutes)

### Service Locator pattern
- Centralized registry: `ServiceLocator.get(ConversionRegistry.class)`
- Pros: Simple to use, single access point
- Cons: Hides dependencies, harder to test, "action at a distance"
  
### Dependency Injection comparison
- Explicit wiring through constructors
- Pros: Dependencies visible in API, easy to test with mocks
- Cons: More verbose, requires infrastructure for large systems

### Tradeoffs summary
- *Readability*: DI makes dependencies explicit in signatures; Service Locator hides them
- *Reusability*: DI components are easily reusable with different implementations
- *Changeability*: Both support swapping implementations, but DI makes it obvious where to change

### When each is appropriate
- DI for application code (testability matters)
- Service Locator sometimes in frameworks (plugin architectures)

## Recognize how code-level patterns manifest at larger architectural scales (10 minutes)

### Where you've been: Patterns at the object level

In Assignments 1-4, you applied these patterns to individual objects:

- **Builder**: `RecipeBuilder` constructs a single `Recipe` with many optional parts (ingredients, instructions, notes, conversion rules). One builder → one object.

- **Factory methods**: `StandardConversions.getRule()` and `StandardConversions.getAllRules()` create conversion rules without exposing how they're stored or computed.

- **Dependency Injection**: When you passed a `ConversionRegistry` to `Recipe.scaleToIngredient()` or `Recipe.convert()`, you were doing manual DI. The recipe doesn't know *which* registry it gets—it just depends on the abstraction.

At this scale, these patterns help you write clean, testable classes. The "wiring"—who creates what and passes it where—happens in a few places (your tests, a main method, maybe a builder).

### Where you're going: Patterns at the service level

In Assignment 5, you'll implement a **service layer architecture** with:
- `ImportService` — imports recipes from JSON, images (via OCR), or other formats
- `ExportService` — exports recipes to markdown, JSON, or other formats  
- `LibraryService` — manages the user's cookbook collection

These services need to collaborate. For example:
- `ImportService` might need `LibraryService` to add imported recipes to a cookbook
- Both services might need a `ConversionRegistry` for unit conversion
- The CLI controller needs all three services to handle user commands

**Now imagine if these services used Singletons:**
```java
public class ImportService {
    public void importRecipe(Path file) {
        Recipe recipe = parseRecipe(file);
        LibraryService.getInstance().addRecipe(recipe);  // Hidden dependency!
    }
}
```

Testing this is painful—you can't substitute a mock `LibraryService`. Changing the library implementation affects everything that calls `getInstance()`. The dependency graph is invisible.

**With Dependency Injection:**
```java
public class ImportService {
    private final LibraryService library;
    private final ConversionRegistry conversions;
    
    public ImportService(LibraryService library, ConversionRegistry conversions) {
        this.library = library;
        this.conversions = conversions;
    }
    
    public void importRecipe(Path file) {
        Recipe recipe = parseRecipe(file);
        library.addRecipe(recipe);  // Dependency is explicit
    }
}
```

Now dependencies are visible in the constructor. Tests can inject mocks. You can swap implementations (e.g., an in-memory library for testing vs. a persistent one for production).

### Same principles, bigger scope

The principles you learned at the object level scale up:

| Object Level (A1-A4) | Service Level (A5+) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `RecipeBuilder` creates a `Recipe` | A "composition root" wires up services |
| `ConversionRegistry` abstracts conversion rules | `LibraryService` abstracts cookbook storage |
| Pass registry to `Recipe.convert()` | Pass services to controllers |
| Test recipes with stub registries | Test controllers with mock services |

The question shifts from "how do I create this object?" to "how do I wire up this whole system?"—but the answer is still: **depend on abstractions, inject implementations, keep coupling loose**.

### Preview: Thinking Architecturally

Next lecture, we step back to ask: **where do service boundaries come from?** We mentioned `ImportService`, `ExportService`, and `LibraryService`—but how did we decide those were the right boundaries? 

We'll explore:
- What distinguishes "architecture" from "design"
- How to identify the natural seams in a problem domain
- How to communicate and document architectural decisions

The patterns you've learned—Builder, Factory, DI—don't disappear at larger scales. They're the building blocks. Architecture is about deciding *which* buildings to construct and *how* they relate.

title: Event-Driven Architecture

## Define and describe the event-driven architecture (10 minutes)

## Compare and contrast event-driven architecture and synchronous communication (10 minutes)

## Define "consistency models" and determine the appropriate consistency model for a given software requirement (20 minutes)

:::note Recall
In [Lecture 22 (Serverless Architecture)](/lecture-notes/l22-serverless), we encountered caching and asked: "What happens when multiple sources of truth diverge? When should the cache refresh?" Those were consistency questions. Now we formalize the concept of consistency models and learn how to choose the right one for different requirements.

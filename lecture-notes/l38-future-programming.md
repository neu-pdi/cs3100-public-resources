## Review major socio-technical trends in software development and speculate on their future impact (20 minutes)

## Debate the ultimate impact of AI on software development (20 minutes)

## Describe approaches for continuous learning and improvement in software development and relevant courses for advanced study (10 minutes)

Whatever trends emerge, one thing is certain: **the ability to learn new things quickly is your most durable asset.** Languages change, frameworks come and go, paradigms shift—but the meta-skill of learning itself compounds over your entire career (or research journey, or whatever path you take).

### Learning agility: The skill behind all skills

Throughout this course, you've practiced learning agility without perhaps naming it:
- You learned a new language (Java) and its ecosystem
- You adapted to new concepts (hexagonal architecture, MVVM, concurrency)
- You learned to work with AI coding tools that didn't exist a few years ago
- You figured out how to debug problems you'd never seen before

These weren't just "course topics"—each was an exercise in rapidly acquiring new competence. That's the skill that transfers.

### Strategies for continuous learning

**Stay curious, not anxious.** The constant churn of new technologies can feel overwhelming. The antidote is curiosity: instead of "I have to learn everything," try "What's interesting here? What problem does this solve?"

**Build things.** Reading about a technology is different from using it. When something interests you, build a small project. The friction of real implementation reveals what you actually understand.

**Find your community.** Learning is easier with others. Find people who share your interests—whether that's a research lab, a meetup group, an online community, or classmates who become collaborators.

### The future is unwritten

We don't know what programming will look like in 10 years. AI might write most code. New paradigms might emerge. The problems worth solving will certainly change.

What we do know: the people who thrive will be those who can learn what's needed, adapt when things change, work effectively with others, and bring clear thinking to complex problems. Those are the skills this course has tried to develop—not because they're "soft skills" separate from "real" technical work, but because they *are* technical work, viewed over time.

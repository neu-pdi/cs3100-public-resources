## Enumerate different tasks that AI programming agents can help with (10 minutes)

AI programming agents can be used throughout the systematic program design and implementation process. It is important that, from the outset, we recognize that they do not *replace* the design and implementation process. For some software problems it may be possible to 

### Tasks across the software development lifecycle
- **Requirements Phase**: Stakeholder analysis, functionality definition, goal refinement
- **Design Phase**: Data type definitions, behavior specifications, example generation
- **Implementation Phase**: Code generation, refactoring, debugging, code review
- **Validation Phase**: Test plan development, test generation, user study protocol development
- **Operations Phase**: Automation design, deployment, feedback analysis, bug fixes

### AI amplifies human capabilities, not replaces them
- AI tools free developers to focus on optimization and business value
- Software is used in a complex socio-technical system. Humans struggle to define that complete context, and AI tools have limited context windows. Humans will always be needed to understand the complete context of a software system.
- Software development is a creative process, and AI tools can help with the creative process, but they can not replace the human creativity and intuition.


## Determine when it is appropriate to use an AI programming agent (10 minutes)

### The fundamental principle: Task familiarity determines appropriateness
- **Use AI when**: You have sufficient domain knowledge to evaluate outputs
- **Avoid AI when**: You lack the expertise to assess correctness and quality
- **Learning consideration**: Using AI without foundational knowledge can lead to deskilling

### The 6-step human-AI collaboration workflow
- **Identify**: Recognize what information AI needs (requires domain knowledge)
- **Engage**: Craft effective prompts with appropriate context
- **Evaluate**: Critical assessment of AI outputs against expected results
- **Calibrate**: Steer AI toward desired outcomes through feedback
- **Tweak**: Refine AI-generated artifacts based on standards
- **Finalize**: Document decisions and rationale

### Risk assessment framework
- Can you recognize hallucinations and errors in the AI's output?
- Do you understand the underlying concepts well enough to guide corrections?
- Will using AI now prevent you from developing essential skills?

## Determine the appropriate level of abstraction and context to provide to the AI programming agent (10 minutes)


### Context from previous phases informs current phase
- **Forward context flow**: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Validation → Operations
- **Backward feedback**: Operations insights must flow back to Requirements
- **AI needs your process context**: Share decisions from earlier phases

### Context provision strategies
- Balancing completeness with relevance
- Recognizing when additional domain knowledge is needed
- Iterative refinement based on AI responses

### Building toward expertise
- How context needs change as your expertise develops
- The importance of maintaining learning opportunities while using AI
- Avoiding over-reliance that leads to skill atrophy

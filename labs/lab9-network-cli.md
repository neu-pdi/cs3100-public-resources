# Lab 9: Network Fault Tolerance

![Lo-fi pixel art showing two students at a workbench covered in small IoT devices—cameras, thermostats, motion sensors—each connected by glowing lines to a central hub labeled 'SceneItAll'. Some lines are flickering red or orange, representing unreliable connections. One student stares at a frozen terminal showing a blinking cursor next to the text 'waiting for device...', while the other sketches a flowchart on paper with labels like 'timeout', 'retry', 'backoff'. On the whiteboard behind them: a list of the Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing, with 'The network is reliable' crossed out in red. A stack of sticky notes on the table reads 'partial failure?'. Warm evening lighting, cozy collaborative workspace atmosphere. Title: 'Lab 9: Network Fault Tolerance'.](/img/labs/web/lab9.png)

In this lab, you'll feel the pain of network failures firsthand—and then fix them. You'll work with
SceneItAll's IoT device ecosystem, where a hub communicates with physical devices over a simulated
network that fails in realistic ways: timeouts, dropped connections, partial failures. The handout
gives you a working CLI and a `DeviceGateway` that assumes the network is perfectly reliable. Your
job is to make it resilient.

## Lab Facilitator Notes

:::tip For TAs: Lab Start (5 minutes)

**Attendance:** Take attendance using the roster in Pawtograder.

**Brief Technical Intro (2 minutes):**

- "Today you'll work with a CLI for SceneItAll's IoT hub. The hub sends commands to physical devices
  over a network—but our simulated network fails in realistic ways."
- "The starter code assumes the network always works. You'll fix that."
- "You'll work individually for the first 15 minutes, then pair up for the rest."

**Soft Skill Focus — Adaptability (3 minutes):**

Read this to students:

> "Today we're practicing _adaptability_—responding professionally when things don't go as planned.
> In real systems, networks fail in ways you didn't anticipate. Your design will encounter failure
> modes it wasn't built for. The question isn't whether to expect the unexpected, but how to respond
> when it happens.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Identify which of the **Fallacies of Distributed Computing** you experienced firsthand, and give
  concrete examples
- Implement **timeout and retry with exponential backoff** in Java to handle unresponsive devices
- Apply **graceful degradation** so that an application remains usable even when some devices are
  unreachable
- Implement a **CLI command** using JLine3 that clearly communicates device status to users
- **Adapt your implementation** when requirements change mid-task

## Before You Begin

**Prerequisites:** Complete
[L20 (Distributed Architecture)](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l20-networks).
You should be familiar with:

- The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing
- Timeout, retry, and exponential backoff patterns
- Graceful degradation and circuit breakers

**Clone the Lab Repository:** Clone your lab9 repository from Pawtograder.

The repository includes:

- `src/` — starter Java code with a working CLI and an unreliable device gateway
- `REFLECTION.md` — where all your written responses go
- `config/` — simulation configuration files for different failure modes

:::tip JLine3 Reference

JLine3 is the library powering SceneItAll's interactive CLI. The provided `ListCommand` and
`OnOffCommand` are fully working examples of the command pattern used in this lab.

Key JLine3 APIs you'll encounter:

```java
// Reading a line from the user
String line = reader.readLine("sceneitall> ");

// Writing output to the terminal
terminal.writer().println("Device 'porch-camera' is unreachable.");
terminal.writer().flush();
```

**Tab completion and history** are built into the CLI. Press Tab to auto-complete command names and
device IDs. Use Up/Down arrows to navigate command history (persisted across sessions in
`~/.sceneitall_history`).

The Command interface includes a `getCompleter()` method that each command can override to provide
argument-aware completion:

```java
// Default: completes just the command name
default Completer getCompleter() {
    return new StringsCompleter(getName());
}

// Override for commands that take device IDs as arguments
@Override
public Completer getCompleter() {
    return new ArgumentCompleter(
        new StringsCompleter(getName()),
        new StringsCompleter(() -> registry.getAllDevices().stream()
            .map(IoTDevice::getId).toList()));
}
```

You don't need to understand JLine3 deeply—follow the patterns in `ListCommand.java`. :::

## The Scenario: SceneItAll's IoT Hub

SceneItAll has expanded: homes now have dozens of IoT devices spread across the property. Each
device—cameras, thermostats, door locks, motion sensors—communicates with a central hub over your
home's network. The hub runs a local server that you interact with via the provided CLI.

In production, devices go offline. Routers reboot. Signals fade. The `DeviceGateway` class handles
all communication between the hub and devices—but right now, it assumes the network is perfectly
reliable. When a device doesn't respond, the CLI hangs. When a device fails mid-command, the CLI
crashes.

Your job today: experience what that looks like, understand _why_, and fix it.

The CLI is already running and supports these commands:

| Command         | Description                             | Provided?                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `list`          | List all registered devices             | ✅                       |
| `on <device>`   | Turn a device on                        | ✅ (uses broken gateway) |
| `off <device>`  | Turn a device off                       | ✅ (uses broken gateway) |
| `help`          | Show available commands                 | ✅                       |
| `status`        | Show all devices with connection status | ❌ **You implement**     |
| `quit` / `exit` | Exit the CLI                            | ✅                       |

---

## Part 1: Experience the Fallacies (15 minutes — Individual)

Before writing any code, you need to _feel_ the problem. Work through this part on your own.

### Exercise 1.1: Run the CLI Against Unreliable Devices

Your repository includes several simulation configurations in the `config/` folder. Start the CLI
with the first failure scenario:

```bash
./run-timeout
```

Once the CLI starts, first try a **working** device to see normal behavior:

```
sceneitall> list
sceneitall> on living-room-thermostat
sceneitall> off living-room-thermostat
```

The thermostat responds immediately. Now try an **unreliable** device:

```
sceneitall> on porch-camera
```

**Observe:** What happens? Does the CLI respond immediately? Does it hang? Does it print an error,
or does it fail silently?

**Tip:** When the CLI hangs, press `Ctrl+C` to terminate it, then restart with `./run-timeout`.

:::note What to look for

The `scenario-timeout.json` configuration makes `porch-camera` unresponsive—it accepts the
connection but never sends a reply. Your CLI will hang indefinitely on the `on porch-camera` command
because `DeviceGateway.sendCommand()` has no timeout.

When it hangs, press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the process, then restart the CLI.

:::

### Exercise 1.2: Intermittent and Partial Failures

Try the other scenarios:

```bash
./run-intermittent
```

Run the same commands several times. Notice that the same command succeeds sometimes and fails other
times.

```bash
./run-mixed
```

This scenario includes multiple devices with different failure modes. Run `list` to see all devices,
then try to control each one.

**For each scenario, take notes in `REFLECTION.md`:**

- What did the CLI do when a device was unresponsive?
- Which of the Eight Fallacies from L20 did this violate?
- What would a user think if they saw this behavior?

### Exercise 1.3: Read the Broken Code

Open `src/main/java/net/sceneitall/iot/lab9/gateway/DeviceGateway.java`. Find the `sendCommand`
method:

```java
public CommandResult sendCommand(String deviceId, DeviceCommand command) {
    DeviceRequest request = new DeviceRequest(deviceId, command);
    return networkClient.send(request);  // No timeout. Blocks forever if device doesn't respond.
}
```

Also look at `readState`:

```java
public DeviceState readState(String deviceId) {
    DeviceRequest request = new DeviceRequest(deviceId, DeviceCommand.READ_STATE);
    return networkClient.send(request).getState();  // Same problem.
}
```

Record in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 1):

- Which specific fallacy does this code violate?
- What happens at the JVM level when `networkClient.send()` blocks forever?
- If you were a user, what would you want the CLI to do instead?

### 🔄 Sync Point 1 — Pair Formation (3 minutes)

**Lab leaders will facilitate pairing:**

- Find a partner you haven't worked with recently
- Share one sentence: _"The most frustrating failure mode I saw was [X], because [Y]."_
- Record your partner's name in `REFLECTION.md`

---

## Part 2: Implement Timeout and Retry (25 minutes — Paired)

Now you'll fix `DeviceGateway`. Work with your partner. Read through the full exercise before
writing any code.

### Exercise 2.1: Add a Timeout (8 minutes)

Open `DeviceGateway.java`. The `networkClient` supports timeouts via an overloaded `send` method:

```java
// Without timeout (current code — blocks forever):
networkClient.send(request)

// With timeout (throws TimeoutException if device doesn't respond in time):
networkClient.send(request, Duration.ofSeconds(5))
```

**Your task:** Update `sendCommand` and `readState` to use a timeout. Choose a reasonable timeout
value for an IoT home network. (Hint: a device that takes more than a few seconds to respond is
probably unresponsive—but a timeout that's too short will falsely report healthy devices as down.)

After your change, test it:

```bash
./run-timeout
sceneitall> on porch-camera
```

The CLI should now fail within your timeout window rather than hanging forever. Record your timeout
choice and reasoning in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 2).

:::note What to catch

`networkClient.send()` throws `TimeoutException` when the timeout expires, and
`DeviceUnreachableException` when the network can't reach the device at all. Handle both.

:::

### Exercise 2.2: Add Retry with Exponential Backoff (12 minutes)

A single timeout is better than hanging forever, but many real failures are _transient_—the device
was briefly busy, the network had a momentary hiccup. Retrying after a short wait often succeeds.

From
[L20](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l20-networks#designing-for-an-unreliable-world),
the pattern is:

```java
int attempts = 0;
while (attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {
    try {
        return networkClient.send(request, TIMEOUT);
    } catch (TimeoutException | DeviceUnreachableException e) {
        attempts++;
        if (attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS) throw new DeviceGatewayException("Device unreachable after " + MAX_ATTEMPTS + " attempts", e);
        long waitMs = (long) Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000;  // 2s, 4s, 8s
        Thread.sleep(waitMs);
    }
}
```

**Your task:** Implement retry with exponential backoff in `DeviceGateway`. Decide:

- How many retry attempts? (Consider: each attempt takes up to your timeout. 3 attempts × 5 second
  timeout = up to 15 seconds before giving up. Is that acceptable for a home automation CLI?)
- Should retrying be the same for `readState` and `sendCommand`? Or should a command that _might
  have already executed_ be retried differently?

Discuss the second question with your partner before writing code. There's no single right
answer—but there is an important difference: `readState` is **idempotent** (reading device state has
no side effects), but `sendCommand` may not be. What happens if you retry `on porch-camera` and the
first attempt actually succeeded?

Record your design decisions and tradeoffs in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 2).

:::tip Testing your retry logic

The `scenario-intermittent.json` config makes `porch-camera` fail roughly 60% of the time. Run:

```bash
./run-intermittent
```

Try `on porch-camera` several times. With retry logic, most attempts should eventually succeed.

:::

### 🔄 Sync Point 2 — Requirements Change (5 minutes)

**Lab leader will make an announcement. DeviceGateway will now also need to handle partial failures.**

After the announcement, discuss with your partner:

- "What assumption does our current code make that this breaks?"
- "Will we throw out our retry logic, modify it, or build on top of it?"

**Exercise 2.3 (post-announcement):** Adapt your `DeviceGateway` to handle partial failures. The
`networkClient.send()` method may now return a `CommandResult` with
`result.isPartialFailure() == true` even when no exception is thrown—the device responded but
reported that the command could not be executed.

Decide:

- Should partial failures be retried? (Unlike transient failures, partial failures may indicate a
  device-level problem, not a network problem.)
- How should `sendCommand` communicate this distinction to callers?

:::tip Testing partial failures

The `scenario-mixed.json` config includes `thermostat-main` with partial failure mode. Run:

```bash
./run-mixed
```

Try `on thermostat-main`. The device responds (no timeout), but reports `isPartialFailure() == true`.
Compare this to `on living-room-thermostat` which succeeds normally.

:::

Record what you changed and what drove your decision in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 3).

---

## Part 3: Implement the `status` Command (20 minutes — Paired)

With a resilient gateway in place, you can now implement a useful CLI command. The `status` command
shows the connection status of every registered device.

### 🔄 Code Walkthrough: The Command Pattern (10 minutes — Lab Leader Led)

:::warning Pay Attention — You'll Need This for HW5

The Command pattern you're about to learn is exactly what you'll want to use for Homework 5. This
walkthrough shows you a clean, extensible way to structure CLI applications. Take notes!

:::

Before implementing your own command, the lab leader will walk through the provided code to explain
how the CLI is structured.

:::tip For TAs: Command Pattern Walkthrough (10 minutes)

Walk students through these four files. Take time to explain each step clearly.

**Step 1: Show `Command.java` (the interface)**

```java
public interface Command {
    String getName();          // The word the user types, e.g. "list"
    void execute(String[] args, Terminal terminal);  // Called when user runs the command
    default Completer getCompleter() { ... }  // For tab-completion (covered in Step 4)
}
```

Point out: `execute` receives the full argument array and the JLine3 `Terminal`. The terminal is the
connection to the user's screen — you write output to it, never to `System.out`. The `getCompleter()`
method is covered in Step 4.

**Step 2: Show `ListCommand.java` (a working example)**

```java
public class ListCommand implements Command {
    private final DeviceRegistry registry;

    public ListCommand(DeviceRegistry registry) {
        this.registry = registry;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() { return "list"; }

    @Override
    public void execute(String[] args, Terminal terminal) {
        List<IoTDevice> devices = registry.getAllDevices();
        if (devices.isEmpty()) {
            terminal.writer().println("No devices registered.");
        } else {
            for (IoTDevice device : devices) {
                terminal.writer().println(device.getId() + " (" + device.getType() + ")");
            }
        }
        terminal.writer().flush();  // Always flush — output may be buffered
    }
}
```

Points to make:

- Dependencies are injected via constructor — `ListCommand` doesn't reach for globals
- `terminal.writer().println(...)` followed by `flush()` is the output pattern
- The `String[] args` is the full tokenized input — `args[0]` is the command name, `args[1]` onward
  are arguments (same convention as `main`)

**Step 3: Show `SceneItAllCLI.java` (the dispatch loop)**

```java
Map<String, Command> commands = new HashMap<>();
commands.put("list", new ListCommand(registry));
commands.put("on", new OnOffCommand(gateway, registry, true));
commands.put("off", new OnOffCommand(gateway, registry, false));
// ...

while (true) {
    String line = reader.readLine("sceneitall> ");
    String[] parts = line.trim().split("\\s+");
    Command cmd = commands.get(parts[0]);
    if (cmd != null) {
        cmd.execute(parts, terminal);
    } else {
        terminal.writer().println("Unknown command: " + parts[0]);
        terminal.writer().flush();
    }
}
```

Point out: adding a new command requires (1) implementing `Command`, and (2) registering it in this
map. That's it. Students add `StatusCommand` here once it's implemented.

**Step 4: Show `Command.getCompleter()` (extending the pattern)**

The Command interface also includes a `getCompleter()` method for tab-completion:

```java
// Default implementation in Command.java — completes just the command name
default Completer getCompleter() {
    return new StringsCompleter(getName());
}
```

Commands that take arguments can override this. For example, `OnOffCommand` provides device ID
completion:

```java
@Override
public Completer getCompleter() {
    return new ArgumentCompleter(
        new StringsCompleter(getName()),
        new StringsCompleter(() -> registry.getAllDevices().stream()
            .map(IoTDevice::getId).toList()));
}
```

The CLI aggregates all command completers and also includes command history (Up/Down arrows,
persisted to `~/.sceneitall_history`). This follows the same extensibility principle: each command
owns both its _execution_ logic and its _completion_ logic.

**Key insight to leave students with:** The Command pattern makes the CLI extensible — adding a new
command never touches existing commands. Just as `execute()` lets each command define its behavior,
`getCompleter()` lets each command define its tab-completion. This is the Open/Closed Principle from
[L8](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l8-design-for-change-2) in
action.

:::

### Exercise 3.1: Implement `StatusCommand`

Open `src/main/java/net/sceneitall/iot/lab9/cli/StatusCommand.java`. The class is stubbed out:

```java
public class StatusCommand implements Command {
    private final DeviceGateway gateway;
    private final DeviceRegistry registry;

    public StatusCommand(DeviceGateway gateway, DeviceRegistry registry) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
        this.registry = registry;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() { return "status"; }

    @Override
    public void execute(String[] args, Terminal terminal) {
        // TODO: For each registered device, attempt to read its state.
        // Show a clear status line for each device, including:
        //   - Device name and type
        //   - Whether it responded (reachable / unreachable / partial failure)
        //   - Its current state if reachable
        // Do NOT crash if a device is unreachable—show it as unreachable and continue.
    }
}
```

**Reference implementation pattern** (from `ListCommand.java`):

```java
@Override
public void execute(String[] args, Terminal terminal) {
    List<IoTDevice> devices = registry.getAllDevices();
    if (devices.isEmpty()) {
        terminal.writer().println("No devices registered.");
    } else {
        for (IoTDevice device : devices) {
            terminal.writer().println(device.getId() + " (" + device.getType() + ")");
        }
    }
    terminal.writer().flush();
}
```

Implement `StatusCommand.execute()`. For each device, call `gateway.readState()`. When it throws
`DeviceGatewayException`, display the device as unreachable rather than propagating the exception.

### Exercise 3.2: Design Your Output Format

Before writing the output, discuss with your partner:

> "Imagine a homeowner using this CLI at 11pm because their front door lock seems unresponsive. They
> run `status`. What information do they actually need? What would be confusing or alarming? What
> would be helpful?"

Two example approaches:

**Option A — Minimal:**

```
porch-camera      [camera]       REACHABLE  — on
front-door-lock   [lock]         UNREACHABLE
living-room-light [dimmable]     REACHABLE  — 60%
thermostat-main   [thermostat]   PARTIAL    — state unknown
```

**Option B — Verbose:**

```
porch-camera (camera)
  Status: REACHABLE
  Current state: on
  Last seen: just now

front-door-lock (lock)
  Status: UNREACHABLE
  ⚠ Could not contact device after 3 attempts. Check device power and network.
```

Neither is universally better—it depends on the user and context. Discuss and choose one (or invent
your own), documenting your reasoning in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 4).

**Test your command:**

```bash
./run-mixed
sceneitall> status
```

All reachable devices should show their current state. Unreachable devices should appear in the
output as unreachable—the CLI should not crash, hang, or silently skip them.

---

## Part 4: Reflection (10 minutes — Individual and Debrief)

Complete the reflection questions below in `REFLECTION.md` while the lab leaders facilitate the
final debrief.

### 🔄 Sync Point 3 — Final Debrief (facilitated by lab leaders)

---

## Reflection

Complete all questions in `REFLECTION.md` before submitting.

**Partner's Name:** ******\_\_\_******

**1. The Command Pattern**

The CLI dispatch loop in `SceneItAllCLI.java` uses the Command pattern. An alternative
implementation would use a chain of `if/else` statements:

```java
// Alternative: if/else chain
if (parts[0].equals("list")) {
    // ... list logic inline ...
} else if (parts[0].equals("on")) {
    // ... on logic inline ...
} else if (parts[0].equals("status")) {
    // ... your new status logic inline ...
}
```

Compare the two approaches:

- What would it take to add a new command in each approach? How many files would you need to touch?
- What would it take to _test_ a single command in isolation in each approach?
- Which coupling type from
  [L7](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l7-design-for-change) does
  the if/else chain exhibit? What about the Command pattern?
- Is there any situation where you'd prefer the if/else approach?

**2. Timeout and Retry Design**

Describe your final implementation of timeout and retry:

- What timeout value did you choose, and why?
- How many retry attempts, and why?
- What is the maximum time a user might wait before getting an answer? Is that acceptable?
- Did you treat `readState` and `sendCommand` differently? Why or why not?

**3. Adapting to Partial Failures**

When the requirements changed to include partial failures:

- What assumption did your original retry logic make that turned out to be wrong?
- What did you change in your implementation?
- Did you modify your existing code, build on top of it, or start over? What drove that decision?

**4. User Communication**

In your `status` command:

- What output format did you choose? Paste a sample output.
- What information did you include? What did you leave out?
- How did you decide what a homeowner user actually needs to see vs. what belongs in a log file?

**5. Meta (pick one)**

- _Connections:_ How does one pattern you implemented (timeout, retry, exponential backoff, graceful
  degradation) connect to a specific concept from
  [L20](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l20-networks)? Be
  specific—quote or reference the lecture material.
- _Real-world parallel:_ Describe a situation outside of programming where you had to adapt when
  something didn't go as planned. What's similar to what you did today?

---

## Optional Extensions

### Extension 1: Circuit Breaker Pattern

The retry approach you implemented still tries every command, even when a device has been
continuously failing for minutes. This wastes time and could overwhelm a struggling device.

The **circuit breaker** pattern (introduced briefly in
[L20](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l20-networks#reliability-fault-tolerance-availability-and-recoverability))
addresses this:

- **Closed** (normal): requests pass through, failures are counted
- **Open** (tripped): requests fail immediately, no network calls made
- **Half-open** (recovery probe): one request is allowed through; if it succeeds, circuit closes
  again

Implement a `CircuitBreaker` class and integrate it into `DeviceGateway`:

```java
public class CircuitBreaker {
    private enum State { CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN }

    private final int failureThreshold;        // How many failures before tripping
    private final Duration openDuration;       // How long to stay open before probing
    private State state = State.CLOSED;
    private int consecutiveFailures = 0;
    private Instant openedAt;

    public boolean allowRequest() { /* ... */ }
    public void recordSuccess() { /* ... */ }
    public void recordFailure() { /* ... */ }
}
```

Update your `status` command to show circuit breaker state per device.

### Extension 2: Graceful Degradation Dashboard

Enhance the `status` command into a richer `dashboard` command that shows:

- All devices with color-coded status using JLine3's `AttributedString`:
  - Green: reachable and healthy
  - Yellow: partial failure or circuit half-open
  - Red: unreachable or circuit open
- Recent failure rate per device (e.g., "3/5 attempts failed in last 60s")

```java
// JLine3 color output example:
AttributedString colored = new AttributedStringBuilder()
    .style(AttributedStyle.DEFAULT.foreground(AttributedStyle.RED))
    .append("UNREACHABLE")
    .style(AttributedStyle.DEFAULT)
    .toAttributedString();
terminal.writer().println(colored.toAnsi());
```

### Extension 3: Idempotency Design Challenge

Consider this scenario: you run `on front-door-lock`. The command reaches the device and executes
successfully, but the acknowledgment is lost on the network. Your retry logic fires. You send the
same command again. The lock was already on.

For a light, this is harmless—turning on a light that's already on has no effect. For a security
system that toggles state on each command, it's a bug.

Explore this question in `REFLECTION.md` (no implementation required):

- Which of SceneItAll's device types have idempotent commands? Which don't?
- How would you redesign `DeviceCommand` or the gateway API to make the distinction explicit?

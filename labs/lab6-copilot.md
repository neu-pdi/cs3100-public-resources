# Lab 6: AI Coding Agents

## Learning Objectives

- Utilize an AI programming agent to assist with a design and implementation task
- Determine the appropriate level of abstraction and context to provide to the AI programming agent
- Consider the long-term maintainability implications of AI-generated code

## Reflection Activity

After completing the coding exercise, discuss with your partner:

1. If you came back to this code in 2 years, what would you need to remember about how it was generated?
2. Did the AI suggest any patterns you wouldn't have chosen? What's the maintenance cost of accepting them?
3. How would you document AI-assisted code for future maintainers?

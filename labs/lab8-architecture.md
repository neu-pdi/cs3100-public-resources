# Lab 8: Hexagonal Architecture

![Lo-fi pixel art showing two students (one male, one female) at a large table. In the center of the table sits a glowing orb labeled 'DatabaseConnection.getInstance()' with tangled red threads spreading outward to sticky notes labeled 'DeviceManager' and 'AutomationRuleEngine'. One student sketches interface designs on paper (labeled 'DeviceRepository' and 'RuleRepository'), while the other has a laptop open showing a Copilot chat window with the prompt 'Generate a mermaid sequence diagram starting from this method'. Between them: a before/after comparison — on the left, a spaghetti diagram with arrows all pointing to the central singleton; on the right, a clean hexagonal diagram with interfaces as boundaries and adapters on the outside (no code legible). A whiteboard behind them shows a simple composition root with constructor calls. On the table, a coffee mug reads 'Inject, Don't Reach' — the DI motto. Title: 'Lab 8: Hexagonal Architecture'. Warm evening lighting, cozy collaborative workspace atmosphere.](/img/labs/web/lab8.png)

In this lab, you'll refactor a tangled monolith into a clean hexagonal architecture — and practice explaining your design decisions clearly. The core skills here are architectural analysis, port and adapter design, and the ability to articulate *why* you made the choices you did.

**This lab uses two different approaches to AI assistance:**
- **Part 2** (DatabaseConnection): You'll design repository interfaces **manually first** with your partner, then use Copilot to verify and refine your design. This ensures everyone practices reasoning through the design before seeing AI output.
- **Part 3** (AutomationRuleEngine): You'll use **Copilot as your primary tool** and practice evaluating whether its output actually follows hexagonal principles (which requires real design judgment).

Either way, you'll explain your decisions to your partner using a structured format introduced after Part 1.

SceneItAll has multiple feature areas that are stepping on each other: infrastructure tangled with business logic, a `DatabaseConnection` singleton that everything reaches for, and code that requires a running IoT network just to run a test. In this lab, you'll focus on **two feature areas** — **Device Management** and **Automation Rules** — and apply hexagonal architecture to untangle them.

:::info Grading: What You Need to Submit

## Lab Facilitator Notes

:::tip For TAs: Lab Start (5 minutes)

**Attendance:** Take attendance using the roster in Pawtograder.

**Brief Intro (2 minutes):**
- "Today you'll analyze SceneItAll's messy codebase and apply hexagonal architecture — separating domain logic from infrastructure and replacing singletons with dependency injection."
- "You'll work individually for the first 15 minutes to form your own analysis of the code. Then you'll pair up."
- "We're focusing on just **two feature areas** today: Device Management and Automation Rules."
- "In Part 2, you'll design repository interfaces **manually first**, then use Copilot to verify. In Part 3, you'll use Copilot as your primary tool. This contrast is intentional — we want you to experience both approaches."

**Soft Skill Focus — Communicating Technical Decisions (3 minutes):**

Read this to students:

> "In professional software work, it's not enough to make a good design decision — you also need to be able to explain it clearly to teammates, to code reviewers, and to people who weren't in the room when you made it.
>
> Today you'll practice a structured format for this:
> **'I chose X because Y. I considered Z, but X is better for this situation because...'**
>
> This isn't just for presentations — it's how you'll explain your port interface choices to your partner, how you'll justify removing the singleton, how you'll communicate in a real code review. We'll use this format explicitly in Part 2 onward."

:::

:::tip For TAs: After Part 1 — Pair Formation (3 minutes)

After Sync Point 1, facilitate pair formation:

- Have students pair up with someone they haven't worked with recently
- If odd number, form one group of three
- **Step 1:** Introduce yourself to your partner. Each person shares one key observation from Part 1 in one sentence, using the format: *"I noticed X in the code, which made me think Y."*
- Remind students to note their partner's name in `REFLECTION.md`

:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Identify what belongs in the **domain** versus **infrastructure** within a feature area, and explain *why* mixing them hurts testability
- Design **port interfaces** that use only domain types and can be trivially stubbed for tests
- Critically evaluate code (whether AI-generated or manually written) using [L16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2) vocabulary: observability, controllability, ports, adapters
- Explain how **dependency injection** eliminates the `DatabaseConnection` singleton and what the resulting composition root looks like
- Communicate design decisions using a structured narrative: *"I chose X because Y. I considered Z, but X is better for this situation because..."*

## Before You Begin

**Prerequisites:** Complete Lectures 16 and 17. You should be familiar with:
- Observability, controllability, and hexagonal architecture ([Lecture 16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2))
- Separating infrastructure from domain code ([Lecture 16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2))
- Dependency injection, singleton anti-pattern, and composition roots ([Lecture 17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns))

**Clone the Lab Repository:** Clone your lab8 repository from Pawtograder.

The repository includes:
- `src/` — starter Java files with the current tangled SceneItAll code
- `REFLECTION.md` — where all your written analysis goes
- `diagrams/` — folder for your port/adapter diagrams

:::tip GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is used in Parts 2 and 3. You can use both **inline completions** (Tab to accept) and **Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I` or the chat panel). [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://github.com/copilot) is also available in a browser.

- **Part 2:** Design manually first, then use Copilot to verify your work
- **Part 3:** Use Copilot as your primary design tool

## Prompting Copilot for Design Tasks (Reference for Parts 2-3)

Here's the key difference between a weak prompt and a strong one for architectural work:

| Weak Prompt | Why It Fails | Stronger Prompt |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| "Extract an interface from this class" | Copilot will mirror the class's current methods, including infrastructure-specific ones | "Extract an interface that represents what the *domain* needs from device state — use only domain types, not Zigbee SDK types" |
| "Refactor to use dependency injection" | Copilot may add DI but leave singletons or add a service locator | "Refactor to use constructor injection. Remove all calls to `getInstance()`. The class should not access any global state." |
| "Generate a repository interface" | May expose storage-specific implementation details in the interface | "Generate a repository interface using only domain types. The interface should have no knowledge of how data is stored." |

**The pattern:** Specify the *design goal* (what principle you're following), the *constraints* (what should be absent from the output), and the *vocabulary* (domain types, not infrastructure types).

---

## The Scenario: SceneItAll's Growing Monolith

SceneItAll has been a single Java application — one `build.gradle`, one `src/` tree, one deployment. It started small, but now it has multiple feature areas that are starting to tangle. For this lab, we'll focus on **two** of them:

1. **Device Management** — Adding, removing, and configuring IoT devices (cameras, thermostats, lights, sensors). Checking device health. Processing firmware update requests.
2. **Automation Rules** — Users create rules like "if motion detected after 10pm, turn on porch light and send alert." Rules reference devices, user preferences, and time.

*(The full system also has Notification, Analytics, and User Management features, but we'll keep our scope narrow today.)*

Right now, these features are jumbled together — classes from different features import each other freely, there's a `DatabaseConnection` singleton that everything uses, and the `AutomationRuleEngine` reaches directly into a hardware SDK to check device states.

Here's an example of what a piece of the current code looks like (also in `src/AutomationRuleEngine.java` in your repo):

```java
public class AutomationRuleEngine {
    public void evaluate(String homeId) {
        List<AutomationRule> rules = DatabaseConnection.getInstance()
                .loadRules(homeId);

        ZigbeeGateway gateway = ZigbeeGateway.getGlobalInstance();

        for (AutomationRule rule : rules) {
            DeviceState state = gateway.readState(rule.getTriggerDeviceId());
            if (rule.conditionMet(state)) {
                List<User> users = DatabaseConnection.getInstance()
                        .loadUsersForHome(rule.getHomeId());
                for (User user : users) {
                    List<NotificationPreference> prefs = DatabaseConnection.getInstance()
                            .loadNotificationPreferences(user.getId());
                    for (NotificationPreference pref : prefs) {
                        if (pref.isEnabled()) {
                            // More code to send the alert
                        }
                    }
                    if (prefs.isEmpty()) {
                        notificationService.sendAlert(user.getId(), rule.getAlertMessage(), NotificationChannel.PUSH);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### The Constraints

- This is a **single deployable application** — one JAR, one `main()`. We're not splitting into separate servers.
- The codebase must be **testable without real IoT hardware** — you need to be able to test business logic (e.g., "should this automation rule fire?") with test doubles, not a live Zigbee network.
- All dependencies between modules should flow through **interfaces**, not concrete classes or singletons (DIP from [L8](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l8-design-for-change-2), DI from [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns)).

---

## Part 1: Understand the Architecture — Individual Work (15 minutes)

Before forming pairs, work through these exercises **on your own**. The goal is to develop your own analysis of the code — you'll bring these observations to your partner when you pair up.

### Exercise 1.1: Dissect AutomationRuleEngine

Look at the `AutomationRuleEngine.evaluate()` code above. Annotate each block manually (no Copilot yet):

1. Which lines are **domain logic** — the actual business decision being made?
2. Which lines are **infrastructure** — database access, hardware calls, HTTP?
3. The `conditionMet(state)` method is on `AutomationRule`. Is that domain or infrastructure? Why?
4. What makes this code **hard to test**? Apply the [L16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2) vocabulary: which parts hurt *controllability*? Which parts hurt *observability*?

Record your annotations in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 1). **Do this before pairing up** — having your own analysis first is how you'll know what's worth discussing with your partner.

### Exercise 1.2: What Would You Need to Stub?

The goal of hexagonal architecture is to make each feature's core logic testable *in isolation* — without spinning up real hardware, real network services, or a real data store.

For each of our two focus areas (**Device Management** and **Automation Rules**), complete this sentence:

> **"To test [feature]'s core business logic in isolation, I would need to stub out _____ ."**

Write your answer for each feature area in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 2).

### 🔄 Sync Point 1

**Lab leaders will facilitate a brief discussion (5 minutes):**
- "What domain logic did you find in AutomationRuleEngine? What made it hard to see?"
- "What would you need to stub to test each feature area?"
- Key insight: "When domain logic is buried between infrastructure calls, you can't test the business rule without also setting up the database and the hardware. Hexagonal architecture extracts the domain so it can be tested in isolation."

*After the sync point: form pairs and read the soft skill introduction below before starting Part 2.*

---

## Pair Formation and Soft Skill Introduction

Find a partner you haven't worked with recently. Before starting Part 2, spend 2 minutes on this:

**Share your Part 1 observation** using this sentence frame:
> *"In AutomationRuleEngine, I noticed [X], which means [consequence for testability]."*

**Soft skill for today: Communicating Technical Decisions**

Throughout Parts 2 and 3, whenever you make or defend a design choice, practice this format:
> *"I chose [design element] because [reason]. I considered [alternative], but [my choice] is better for this situation because [specific reason]."*

Your partner's job when listening: ask *"Why did you prioritize that?"* — not to challenge, but to draw out more of your reasoning.

Record your partner's name in `REFLECTION.md`.

---

## Part 2: Fix the DatabaseConnection Singleton (25 minutes)

The `DatabaseConnection` singleton is SceneItAll's biggest design problem — and also the most concrete place to start learning hexagonal architecture. Every feature area reaches for it directly, which means nothing can be tested in isolation.

In this part, you'll **design the replacement manually first** (with your partner), then use **Copilot to verify and refine** your design.

### The Problem: One Giant Singleton

```java
// Current code — in src/DatabaseConnection.java
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;

    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection(); // connects to production data store
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Methods for every feature area — one giant object everyone shares:
    public List<AutomationRule> loadRules(String homeId) { /* ... */ }
    public void saveRule(AutomationRule rule) { /* ... */ }
    public List<IoTDevice> loadDevices(String homeId) { /* ... */ }
    public void saveDevice(IoTDevice device) { /* ... */ }
    public DeviceHealth checkDeviceHealth(String deviceId) { /* ... */ }
    // ... and many more
}
```

### Exercise 2.1: Discover the Coupling (5 minutes)

Before designing a fix, let's see how severe the problem is. The `DatabaseConnection` singleton is used throughout the codebase. Here are two examples:

**In `DeviceManager.java`:**
```java
public class DeviceManager {
    public void addDevice(String homeId, IoTDevice device) {
        // Singleton call — can't test without a real database!
        DatabaseConnection.getInstance().saveDevice(device);
        // ...
    }
}
```

**In `AutomationRuleEngine.java`:**
```java
public void evaluate(String homeId) {
    // Singleton call — can't test without a real database!
    List<AutomationRule> rules = DatabaseConnection.getInstance().loadRules(homeId);
    // ...
}
```

**Now use VS Code to find all references:**

1. Open `src/DatabaseConnection.java` in VS Code
2. Right-click on `getInstance` and select **"Find All References"** (or press `Shift+F12`)
3. Count how many files call this method

Take note of how many files reference this method — you'll use this observation in your discussion.

### Exercise 2.2: Diagnose the Problem (5 minutes)

With your partner discuss these three questions **before designing any replacement**:

1. From [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns): what are the **three problems** with singletons? Give a concrete example of each in the context of `DatabaseConnection`.
2. From [L16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2): does this singleton hurt **observability**, **controllability**, or both? Explain specifically.
3. If two tests run concurrently and both call `DatabaseConnection.getInstance()`, what could go wrong?

### Exercise 2.3: Design Repository Interfaces — Manual First (10 minutes)

Now for the fix. You'll create a **parallel design** — new repository interfaces that will replace `DatabaseConnection` for our two focus areas: **Device Management** and **Automation Rules**. The old singleton can remain for other feature areas; this lets you compare the old and new approaches side by side.

**Step 1: Manual Design (with your partner, no Copilot yet)**

For each of the two feature areas, design a repository interface. Ask yourselves:
- What operations does this feature area need from data storage?
- What domain types should the interface use? (Not infrastructure types!)
- How narrow can we make this interface while still being useful?
- How, if at all, should the domain types be adjusted?

Sketch your interfaces on paper or in a scratch file. For example, you might design:

```java
// For Device Management
public interface DeviceRepository {
    // What operations does DeviceManager actually need?
}

// For Automation Rules
public interface RuleRepository {
    // What operations does AutomationRuleEngine actually need?
}
```

**Step 2: Verify with Copilot**

Once you have a draft, use Copilot to check your design:
> *"I'm replacing this DatabaseConnection singleton with dependency injection. Here's my draft interface for [DeviceRepository/RuleRepository]. Does this interface correctly express what the domain needs for data access? Does it leak any storage-specific implementation details? Suggest improvements."*

Compare Copilot's feedback to your manual design. Did it catch anything you missed? Did it suggest anything that actually *violates* hexagonal principles (like adding infrastructure types)?

**Record in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 3):**
- Your manual draft for each interface
- What Copilot suggested (if different)
- Your final interface design and why you chose it: *"I defined [interface] as [description] because [reason]."*

### Exercise 2.4: Create In-Memory Implementations (5 minutes)

For **one** of your repository interfaces, create an `InMemory*` implementation that uses a `HashMap` for storage. This is what you'd use in tests instead of the real database.

You can use Copilot for this:
> *"Generate an `InMemoryDeviceRepository` class that implements `DeviceRepository` using a `HashMap`. It should have no dependencies on `DatabaseConnection` or any external systems."*

Evaluate the result:
- Does it implement your interface correctly?
- Does it have any calls to `DatabaseConnection`? (It shouldn't — that's the whole point!)
- Could you use this in a unit test that runs in milliseconds?

Record your implementation and evaluation in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 4).

### 🔄 Sync Point 2

**Before the group discussion:** Share one interface design decision with your partner using the structured format — "I defined X as Y because..."

**Lab leaders will facilitate a discussion (5 minutes):**
- "What did your manual design look like before you checked it with Copilot?"
- "Did Copilot's suggestions improve your design, or did it suggest things that violated hexagonal principles?"
- Key insight: "Manual design forces you to reason from first principles. Copilot can help verify and refine, but it often suggests patterns from training data — including legacy code that violates exactly the principles you're learning. The combination of both approaches is powerful."

---

## Part 3: Design Ports for AutomationRuleEngine — Copilot Focus (15 minutes)

Now that you've tackled the `DatabaseConnection` singleton (which affects data access across the system), let's apply hexagonal architecture to the `AutomationRuleEngine` itself. This class has **multiple infrastructure dependencies** beyond just the database — it also reaches directly into hardware SDKs and HTTP clients.

In this part, you'll use **Copilot as your primary design tool** and practice evaluating AI-generated output against hexagonal principles.

### What Makes a Good Port (Review from [L16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2))

```java
// Good port: uses domain types, defined by what the DOMAIN needs
public interface DeviceStatePort {
    DeviceState getCurrentState(String deviceId);
}

// Bad port: leaks infrastructure types into the interface
public interface ZigbeeInterface {
    ZigbeeFrame sendFrame(byte[] payload);  // What the heck is a "ZigbeeFrame"???? It must be infrastructure!
}
```

A good port: uses **domain types** not infrastructure types; is **narrow** (only what's needed); can be **trivially stubbed** for tests.

### Exercise 3.1: Use Copilot to Design Ports (6 minutes)

Look back at the `AutomationRuleEngine.evaluate()` code from Part 1. It has three infrastructure dependencies:
1. **Data access** (you already designed a repository interface for this in Part 2!)
2. **Device state reads** — the `ZigbeeGateway.getGlobalInstance()` call
3. **Notification sending** — the direct `HttpClient` call

Use Copilot to generate port interfaces for the device state and notification dependencies:

> *"I'm applying hexagonal architecture to this class. Identify the external dependencies and generate Java interface definitions for each one as ports. Each interface should use only domain types — no SDK types like ZigbeeFrame, no infrastructure types like HttpResponse."*

**Evaluate Copilot's output:**
- Does each interface use domain types or infrastructure types?
- Is it narrow enough to be stubbed with a lambda in a test?
- Did Copilot miss any dependencies?

If Copilot gets it wrong, write a follow-up prompt — for example:
> *"The `readState` method returns a `ZigbeeFrame`. That's an infrastructure type. Rewrite the interface so it returns `DeviceState` instead, where `DeviceState` is a domain object."*

Record in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 5):
- Your initial prompt
- Problems in the first response (if any)
- Follow-up prompts you used
- Your final port interfaces

### Exercise 3.2: Diagram Your Ports (4 minutes)

Create a **Mermaid diagram** showing the hexagonal architecture for **Automation Rules** — the domain, port interfaces, at least one production adapter, and one test double.

Ask Copilot to generate a Mermaid diagram:
> *"Generate a Mermaid diagram showing the hexagonal architecture for AutomationRuleEngine with the port interfaces we designed. Show the domain in the center, ports as interfaces, production adapters on one side, and test doubles on the other."*

Save the result in `diagrams/automation-rules.md`. Check that your diagram correctly shows:
- Adapters depending on ports (arrows point inward)
- Test doubles implementing the same ports as production adapters
- The domain depending only on port interfaces, not on adapters

> 💡 **Mermaid hint** if Copilot needs guidance:
> ```
> graph LR
>     subgraph Domain["Automation Rules Domain"]
>         RE[AutomationRuleEngine]
>         RP[RuleRepositoryPort <<interface>>]
>         DS[DeviceStatePort <<interface>>]
>     end
>     ...
> ```

Record what you produced and whether it correctly shows the hexagonal pattern in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 6).

### Exercise 3.3: Design the Composition Root (5 minutes)

If we inject all these dependencies, *someone* has to wire them up. In [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns) we called this the **composition root**.

Use Copilot:
> *"Show me what `SceneItAllApplication.main()` should look like after applying dependency injection throughout. It should create all the production adapter implementations for DeviceManager and AutomationRuleEngine, then wire them in via constructor injection. There should be no calls to any `getInstance()` methods anywhere."*

Evaluate the result:
- Does it still contain any `getInstance()` calls? (Flag them if so.)
- Is it clear that this is the **only** place in the codebase that knows about concrete implementations?
- Does it look like the [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns) composition root pattern?

Record the composition root design and your evaluation in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 7).

### 🔄 Sync Point 3 (5 minutes)

**Lab leaders will check in:**
- "Did Copilot generate ports with infrastructure types? How did you fix it?"
- "Did anyone's composition root have surprising complexity? What caused it?"
- "Did Copilot remove all singleton calls, or miss some?"
- Key insight: "Copilot often generates ports that reflect patterns from training data — including legacy code that violates hexagonal principles. Your job is to evaluate the output critically. The composition root reveals the full dependency graph of your system at a glance."

---

## Part 4: Design Review and Reflection (10 minutes)

### Exercise 4.1: Explain a Decision to Another Pair

Find another pair and share screens or swap `REFLECTION.md` files. Each person explains **one key design decision** using the structured format:

> *"I chose [design element] because [reason]. I considered [alternative], but my choice is better for this situation because [specific reason connecting to testability or hexagonal architecture principles]."*

The listener's role: ask *"Why did you prioritize that quality attribute?"* and *"What would break if you'd gone with the alternative?"*

### Exercise 4.2: Technical Review

With the other pair, review each other's port interfaces:

1. **Infrastructure leakage check:** Do any port interfaces mention infrastructure types (HTTP, Zigbee, AWS, SMTP, or storage-specific details)?
2. **Singleton check:** Does the composition root have any `getInstance()` calls remaining?
3. **Testability check:** For each port, ask: "Could this be stubbed with a lambda or a simple in-memory class?" If not, what makes it hard to stub?

Record one observation from the review (for either pair's work) in `REFLECTION.md` (Question 8).

### Exercise 4.3: Thinking About a New Feature Area

Throughout this lab, we focused on two feature areas: **Device Management** and **Automation Rules**. But SceneItAll also has other features we didn't touch: Notifications, Analytics, and User Management.

**Think about adding a new feature area** — for example, **Analytics & Reporting** (which queries historical device data, generates usage reports, and calculates trends).

In `REFLECTION.md` (Question 9), answer:
- What ports (interfaces) would the Analytics domain need?
- Would Analytics share any ports with Device Management or Automation Rules, or would it need entirely new ones?
- How would you add Analytics to the composition root you designed in Part 3?

**You don't need to write any code** — just think through how the hexagonal architecture pattern would extend to this new area.

### 🔄 Sync Point 4 (Final Debrief — 10 minutes)

*Soft skill debrief:*
- "What made your partner's explanation of a design decision convincing — or not?"
- "Did the structured format ('I chose X because Y') change how you thought about your own decision while explaining it?"

*Technical debrief:*
- "What was the trickiest port to design today, regardless of how you approached it?"
- "How did the manual-first approach (Part 2) compare to the Copilot-first approach (Part 3)?"
- "When you thought about adding Analytics, what ports did you identify?"
- Key insight: "The ability to explain *why* you made a design decision is as important as making the right one. And hexagonal architecture should make it straightforward to add new feature areas — if it's hard to see where a new feature fits, the architecture might need work."

7. **Composition root:** Your `main()` design and evaluation — any remaining `getInstance()` calls? Does it match the [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns) pattern?

### Part 4: Design Review and Reflection

8. **Review observation:** One thing you noticed during the peer review — an infrastructure leak, a leftover singleton call, or a particularly clean port design. What would you change (or keep), and why?

9. **New feature area:** What ports would Analytics & Reporting need? Would it share ports with the existing feature areas? How would you add it to the composition root?

### Meta

10. **Connections:** Pick one of your port design decisions and explain how it connects to a specific concept from an earlier lecture — a coupling type from [L7](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l7-design-for-change), DIP from [L8](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l8-design-for-change-2), observability/controllability from [L16](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l16-testing2), or DI vs. singleton from [L17](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l17-creation-patterns). Be specific: name the concept and explain the connection.

11. **Communication reflection:** Think about the structured decision format you practiced today — *"I chose X because Y. I considered Z, but X is better because..."* Was there a moment where articulating the reasoning out loud changed or clarified your thinking? What's one design decision from today that you could explain convincingly to a teammate who wasn't here?

12. **AI tool reflection:** How did the manual-first approach (Part 2) compare to the Copilot-first approach (Part 3)? Which felt more effective for learning? Which would you use in a real project?

## Optional Extensions

### Stretch Goal 1: Write a Meaningful Unit Test

Using the port interfaces you designed, write a JUnit 5 test for the `AutomationRuleEngine` that:
- Stubs all port interfaces using either lambdas or simple `InMemory*` implementations
- Tests a specific business scenario (e.g., "rule fires when motion is detected after 10pm")
- Runs in under 100ms with no real hardware, database, or network

Was writing the test easier or harder with the new port-based design than it would have been with the original singleton-based code?

### Stretch Goal 2: Extend to Notification System

Apply what you learned to the **Notification System** feature area. In [Lab 4](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/labs/lab4-changeability), you analyzed three implementations of SceneItAll's notification logic:
- A "big ball of mud" with all logic in one class (`NotificationManager` with conditional statements)
- A class-based Strategy pattern (`NotificationStrategy` interface with `ImmediateNotificationStrategy`, etc.)
- A functional/lambda-based approach using `Predicate` and `BiConsumer`

You evaluated each for changeability when adding new channels, new filtering logic, and cross-cutting concerns.

Now apply hexagonal architecture to the notification system. Design:
- A `NotificationPort` interface that expresses what the domain needs
- An `InMemoryNotificationPort` for testing
- How it would integrate with the composition root

Compare your design to the evaluation criteria you used in Lab 4. Does the hexagonal architecture approach produce a design that's easier to swap implementations? How does a port-based design compare to the Strategy pattern designs you analyzed?

### Stretch Goal 3: Notification Port Design Challenge

Evaluate two competing designs for `NotificationPort`:

**Option A:**
```java
public interface NotificationPort {
    void sendAlert(String userId, String message, NotificationChannel channel);
}
```

**Option B:**
```java
public interface NotificationPort {
    void sendAlert(AlertRequest request);
}
// where AlertRequest contains userId, message, channel, priority, quietHoursOverride, ...
```

Which better follows Interface Segregation ([L8](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l8-design-for-change-2))? Which creates data coupling vs. stamp coupling ([L7](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs3100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l7-design-for-change))? If you ask Copilot to generate a `NotificationPort`, which style does it gravitate toward?

# Lecture Slides

These are the lecture slides for CS 3100. Lecture slides complement the lecture notes in the [lecture-notes](/lecture-notes) directory, and it is suggested that students read the lecture notes in advance of lecture. The lecture notes also contain links to supplementary material that may be useful for further study.

# CS 3100: Program Design and Implementation II

**Prerequisites:** CS 2100 or equivalent

**Credits:** 4 credit hours

## Course Description

Building on foundations introduced in CS 2100, examines program design at increasing scales of complexity. Reviews abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and interfaces in statically-typed object-oriented languages. Presents a comparative approach to software design patterns and paradigms, including object-oriented and functional programming. Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of program design, including interface design, test-driven development, graphical design notations, reusable software components, and open-source ecosystems. Illustrates the impact of design-time decisions on software correctness, including accessibility, changeability, performance, reusability and privacy. Students collaborate throughout the semester to design and implement a large software project.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply software design patterns and architectural principles to complex programming problems
- Develop and test software using test-driven development methodologies
- Design and implement user interfaces with attention to usability and accessibility
- Work effectively in teams on large-scale software projects
- Understand and contribute to open-source software ecosystems
- Evaluate software correctness, performance, and maintainability

## Course Structure

The course consists of lectures, labs, assignments, and a semester-long project. Please see the [Schedule](/schedule) for specific dates and topics.
